# Mask Galaxy Book laptop 
# edited  by manas c
This .bat script will allow you to mimic your windows pc as a Galaxy Book laptop, this is usually used to bypass Samsung's restriction on some applications such as Samsung Notes by modifying the registry. _Third-party antivirus applications such as Kaspersky and Bitfinder detecting the .bat file as a threat, it is a false positive! Just whitelist it or modify the registry yourself if that is the case._

### 4 versions
- Galaxybook_mask.bat
- Galaxybook_mask(no startup).bat
- samsungnotes-better.bat: Non startup version that launches samsung   notes, can be used as  a makeshift shortcut
- (Recommended)samsungnotes-betterv2.bat:This version stores the previous  registery key that it changes  and then reverts the key back  once the  app has  been launched
